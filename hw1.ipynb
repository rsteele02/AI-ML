I detected and removed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to prevent them from affecting the analysis.\n","\n","In the feature selection phase, I used the Chi-Square test to evaluate the relationship between categorical features and the target variable (`<=50K`). I encoded categorical features into numerical values using Label Encoding before applying the Chi-Square test. The results highlighted the most significant features based on their Chi-Square scores and p-values.\n","\n","I then moved to feature extraction by implementing binning. This technique converted continuous variables, such as age, into discrete categories, simplifying the data and potentially enhancing model performance.
